# Supabase Status

**Status date:** 2026-08-14
**Project:** Aida System
**Ref:** `eswovqxqzfevcdwwcmuh`
**Region:** `ap-southeast-1`

## Identity/membership

Existing identity/member objects remain live with forced RLS:

- `user_profiles`
- `members`
- `student_verifications`

Trusted role helpers and admin/owner member-directory functions remain unchanged.

Closeout evidence (dated snapshot, not an invariant):

- Auth users: 9
- profiles: 9
- members: 6
- trusted roles: 1 owner, 1 admin, 1 staff

The member population is five seeded customers plus one physically created test customer. Employee identities are intentionally not member/loyalty rows.

## Catalogue — TASK-MENU-001

Live catalogue objects remain:

- `catalogue_categories`
- `catalogue_items`
- `catalogue_item_variants`
- `catalogue_item_addons`
- `catalogue_revision`
- `catalogue_audit_events`

Seed baseline remains:

- 4 categories
- 16 items
- 27 variants
- 27 compatible add-on links
- catalogue revision 15 at the closeout baseline

The latest audit includes a real Owner mutation performed by `owner.evelyn.demo@aida.test`; the changed price was observed by the installed customer app.

Catalogue authority and regression behavior are unchanged by TASK-DEMO-ORDER-001.

## Orders and scheduling — TASK-DEMO-ORDER-001

Canonical repository migrations are now aligned exactly to their live ledger versions:

1. `20260812182212_create_authoritative_orders_and_scheduling.sql`
2. `20260812183029_index_order_foreign_keys.sql`

Live tables:

- `order_schedule_settings`
- `orders`
- `order_lines`
- `order_line_addons`
- `order_events`

All five have RLS enabled and FORCE RLS.

Live public RPC contract:

- `get_ordering_policy()`
- `quote_order(jsonb)`
- `place_customer_order(jsonb)`
- `place_pos_order(jsonb)`
- `get_order(uuid)`
- `get_my_orders(integer)`
- `list_orders(text[], integer)`
- `transition_order_status(uuid,text,bigint,text)`
- `save_ordering_policy(jsonb)`

Private SECURITY DEFINER helpers perform narrowly scoped controlled persistence behind SECURITY INVOKER public entrypoints with explicit caller/role checks. Ordinary authenticated clients have no direct INSERT/UPDATE grants on order commercial tables.

Current scheduling singleton:

```text
timezone                 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
schedule_enabled         true
minimum_lead_minutes     15
slot_interval_minutes    15
maximum_advance_days     7
```

Branch-specific opening hours/closures/capacity are not modeled in the current schema.

Current retained order state at the 2026-08-14 closeout baseline:

- orders: 0
- order lines: 0
- order-line add-ons: 0
- order events: 0

The numeric identity sequence may contain gaps after transactional regression because PostgreSQL sequences are non-transactional; order-number uniqueness/authority is unaffected and no synthetic order row remains.

Final live E2E evidence on 2026-08-17 supersedes only the retained-order count, not the dated identity/catalogue baseline:

- retained orders: 1;
- order `100006` / `7cf027dc-3ff0-4604-a3fd-c7a943aac603`;
- customer source, ASAP fulfilment, authoritative total 1,290 sen;
- persisted lifecycle `confirmed` v1 → `preparing` v2 → `ready` v3 → `completed` v4;
- customer-owned `get_order` reads observed every changed status;
- Dashboard Owner BFF queue/detail reads observed the same persisted record.

The order remains intentionally retained as TASK-CLOSEOUT-001 evidence. It was created through `place_customer_order`, not SQL or service-role access.

## Realtime

`supabase_realtime` currently publishes exactly the two intended mutable signals:

- `catalogue_revision`
- `orders`

Catalogue clients re-fetch the full catalogue after revision change. Order clients re-fetch an authorized full order snapshot after an order-header change. Immutable order lines/add-ons are not separately published.

## TASK-DEMO-ORDER-001 validation

`supabase/tests/order_integration.sql` passed transactionally against the live project and rolled back all synthetic users/orders.

It proved:

- anonymous authoritative quote access;
- no anonymous placement/status capability;
- no direct authenticated order-table DML;
- forged client price/total fields ignored;
- live `CF-SCL` Medium + Oat Milk price resolution;
- incompatible add-on rejection;
- past schedule rejection;
- customer scheduled placement with trusted member derivation;
- immutable line/add-on snapshots;
- idempotent retry and key-reuse conflict;
- customer owner-scoped history;
- customer status-mutation denial;
- staff queue and POS guest order creation;
- versioned legal status transitions;
- stale/illegal transition rejection;
- admin-only scheduling policy update.

The order migration regression previously passed with no schema/RLS lint. The current project security advisor reports one hosted Auth WARN: `auth_leaked_password_protection` (**Leaked Password Protection Disabled**). Do not describe the current project as having zero security-advisor findings.

Performance advisor initially identified four unindexed new foreign keys. The second forward migration added covering indexes. Final performance findings are `unused_index` INFO only, which is expected on a new/empty order dataset; there are no remaining unindexed-FK findings.

## Historical migration-ledger drift

The pre-order identity/catalogue migrations retain the previously documented historical filename/live-version differences:

| Repository version | Live version | Name |
|---|---|---|
| `20260811101100` | `20260811101525` | `create_identity_membership_foundation` |
| `20260811102200` | `20260811101620` | `harden_foundation_role_helpers` |
| `20260811102700` | `20260811101641` | `optimize_foundation_rls_policies` |
| `20260812191500` | `20260812112337` | `integrate_customer_auth_member_directory` |
| `20260812192500` | `20260812112457` | `fix_signup_member_code_generation` |
| `20260812195500` | `20260812113040` | `make_admin_member_directory_security_invoker` |
| `20260812231500` | `20260812152607` | `create_shared_catalogue` |
| `20260812235000` | `20260812154805` | `harden_catalogue_rls_policies` |

Those eight were already proven semantically equivalent and are not schema drift. Do not rewrite applied historical migrations.

For TASK-DEMO-ORDER-001, the migration source was committed before live application and then the repository filename was aligned to the exact version returned by the migration ledger without changing SQL contents. The order migration ledger and canonical filenames therefore match exactly.

## Current public schema inventory

Current active public base tables consist of:

- 3 identity/member tables
- 6 catalogue tables
- 5 order/scheduling tables

Total: 14 public base tables, all within the accepted shared-backend architecture.

Legacy ledger rows describing older removed objects remain historical ledger evidence; they are not current live public schema authority.
